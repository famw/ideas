## Game AI Research Topics
AI in games is mainly used for:
* NPC behavior
* Custom/Procedural Content creation

The idea here is to work on a project that explores AI in games. We have identified the following potential approaches to this subject:

# Use of academic AI on Games 
The use of academic AI in games is not that common. Usually, game developers try to focus on simpler solutions to mimic intelligent behavior -- such as FSMs and Behavior Trees. A few reasons behind this decision are:
* AI in games has to be "fun" and "beatable"
* Games have real-time restrictions and some methods simply require too much time
* Unpredictability of AI can sometimes be "bad" for gameplay and experience

However, a few games have already used academic AI methods and were succesful:
[Top 10 Most Influential AI Games](http://aigamedev.com/open/highlights/top-ai-games/)
[Planning in Games](http://aigamedev.com/open/review/planning-in-games/)
[Black & White Postmortem](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131476/postmortem_lionhead_studios_.php)
[Paper on Black & White's AI](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~brown/242/assts/termprojs/games.pdf)

The goal here is to explore which "academic" AI methods have already been used -- or could be used -- in games and package them in some kind of AI Middleware. This would be benefitial because:
* Developers could explore different (and powerful) AI techniques
* Introduce dynamic behaviors, potentially removing the "scripted" feel of some games

As proof of concept, we would develop some sample games using the new framework.

# AI Testbed Framework
A good way to test AI solutions is using games. The goal here is to build a framework similar to:
* [MicroRTS](https://github.com/santiontanon/microrts)

That would allow AI developers to test new techniques of AI for a specific game genre.
