# Build an AI to play a game
---
There a a few limitations here, though. We need to select games that give easy access to their AI modules (Open Source, preferably). Old games would be ideal aswell, since they tend to be much simpler.

Meneguzzi gave a few suggestions:
*[MicroRTS](https://github.com/santiontanon/microrts)
*[Battle for Westnoth](http://www.wesnoth.org/)

The [SpelunkBots idea](spelunkbots-ai.md) is related to this.

I don't have a suggestion right now (sorry ;-;).
